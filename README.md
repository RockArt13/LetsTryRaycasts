# LetsTryRaycasts
The individual assignment for the Advanced Game Development course.

# #AboutTheProject
This project was made during one day.

The tutorial implementation: https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/let-s-try-shooting-with-raycasts

The important keys are

## 1. Detecting when a player is looking at something and trigger a sound or animation.

## 2. Make the player interact with objects only if they are facing them, by pointing their camera at them (more specifically at their colliders which can be bigger/smaller than the object).

## 3. Detect whether an object (player or other) in on/off the ground (however it would be more efficient to use triggers instead).

# #AboutAssets

All assets (graphics, sound, and music) are downloaded free from the websites providing free assets. 

# #RunTheGame
A build still needs to be created.
Feel free to run the game from Unity.
